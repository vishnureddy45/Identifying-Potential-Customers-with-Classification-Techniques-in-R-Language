# Identifying-Potential-Customers-with-Classification-Techniques-in-R-Language

Data mining techniques and algorithms such as Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are most commonly used for predicting a specific outcome such as response / no-response, high / medium / low-value customer, likely to buy / not buy.

To build classification models to identify the potential customers who are likely to buy a product. We will build models with SVM.

A support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks. We will use the svm() function in the e1071 package to build the classification models.
